Basically i opened the virtual machine and ran the ls command with -la argument to list the hidden files and catted the first flag. For the second flag, i changed the directory to /var/log then i ran the grep command with the keyword "Failed password" in the auth.log file. For the third flag i switched to root user by using the sudo su command then i checked the bash history by catting the .bash_history file.
