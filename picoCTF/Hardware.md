# 1. IQ Test

> let your input x = 30478191278.

wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.

As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.

## Solution:

- i converted the given number in the desc.txt into 36 bit binary number and entered each digit in the respective inputs in the logic gates circuit and solved to get the digits of the flag.

## Flag:
```
nite{100010011000}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learned the AND,OR,NOR,NAND,XOR, and XNOR gates with thier truth tables

## Notes:

- i just went on solving the logic gates with their correct truth tables.
