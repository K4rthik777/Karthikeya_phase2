# 1. Web Gauntlet

>Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:51442/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:51442/filter.php


## Solution:

- i opened both the links and found a login page in the first link and a blank page with a clue in the other link which suggest that Round 1 was something to do with or. So by the hints i got that sql injections needed to be used to get the admin status in each round. So for the first round i tried used (--) with the admin word and it worked.Then the filter.php got updated with -- as well and in this round it didn't work anymore. so i tried something else like (;) with the same admin word and it also worked. Then

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt how different sql injection comments can be made using different characters and be used to expolit such conditions.

## Notes:

- I initially thought that palying around with cookies of the login site might get me the admin sttus but it didnm't work

# 2. SSTI1

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.


## Solution:

-i used the fuzzing to find that this website has vunerablility to SSTI.Then i found that code within double curly braces got executed.So i ran the code to use ls the directories for any further clues and found the flag file. THen i catted that flag file.

The error shown after fuzzing :

THe listing command: 

```
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('ls').read() }}
```

The catting command:

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_bcf73b04}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- i learned about how to detect ssti vunerabilities usinf fuzzing technique. Also how to use SSTI payload to expolit the vunerablitlies.

## Notes:

- i kept using some wrong payloads and kept getting errors as i didn't know which payload would work.
