>Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:51442/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:51442/filter.php


## Solution:

- i opened both the links and found a login page in the first link and a blank page with a clue in the other link which suggest that Round 1 was something to do with or. So by the hints i got that sql injections needed to be used to get the admin status in each round. So for the first round i tried used (--) with the admin word and it worked.Then the filter.php got updated with -- as well and in this round it didn't work anymore. so i tried something else like (;) with the same admin word and it also worked. Then
