# 1. buffer overflow 0

>Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.
Connect using:
nc saturn.picoctf.net 51815


## Solution:

- i connected to netcat connection and found that it was just a program to take input from user. Then i opened the source code and found that  the inputted value was getting copied to a another string array with only 16 size so it was possible to cause buffer overflow with this. The buffer overflow here triggered the sigsegv_handler() to print the flag.

The netcat connection in the terminal -

The flag obtained after overflowing the limit of buf2[] :

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

## Concepts learnt:

-i learnt about how the vulnerability of string functions due to buffer overflow can be exploited 

## Notes:

- i just saw the source code having the flag.txt and tried to get that file but it was not possible to directly get that file.
