# 1. buffer overflow 0

>Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.

## Solution:

- i connected to netcat connection and found that it was just a program to take input from user. Then i opened the source code and found that  the inputted value was getting copied to a another string array with only 16 size so it was possible to cause buffer overflow with this. The buffer overflow here triggered the sigsegv_handler() to print the flag.

The flag obtained after overflowing the limit of buf2[] :

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

## Concepts learnt:

-i learnt about how the vulnerability of string functions due to buffer overflow can be exploited 

## Notes:

- i just saw the source code having the flag.txt and tried to get that file but it was not possible to directly get that file.

## Solution:

- i connected to netcat connection and found that it was just a program to take burger recommendation for patrick and for sponge bob from the given options. i tried giving each option but for patrick the grilled cheese worked and then for bob  Cla%sic_Che%s%steak worked to print the flag.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4}
```

## Concepts learnt:

-i learned about how the format string vulnerability in c programs can be exploited.

## Notes:

- i just kept trying to give each option and it didn't work for most of the combinations.

## Solution:

- i used python code to print 264 'A's to cause buffer overflow of gets() function and also echoed the 0xdeadbeef in hexadecimal form at the end of it and piped these as input for the netcat connection given and that got the flag to be printed.
```
(python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.write("A" * 264)'; echo -e '\xef\xbe\xad\xde') | nc mars.picoctf.net 31890
