# NITE CTF

## 1. Database Reincursion:
i tried passing different payloads like ' or 1=1-- but it got filtered. i again tried with OR and -- comments but they were also filtered.Then i tried other comment like # and || 
instead these were not filtered but it got returned as invalid. So i kept trying more using these but it wasn't working.Also i tried switching between ' and " to see if anything changed but 
it didn't. Also i tried playing around the cases of the payloads but it wasn't useful. I used UNION and SELECT to count the columns but it didn't return the no of columns.

## 2. Cornfield Chase :
In the view provided, using the electric pole sign i found that this could be in Taiwan. Then i searched for such field near a highway bridge and found posssible places in Chiayu County and 
and Yunlin County. Finally found the location in th Chiayu County.

## 3. Hillbilly:
I thought the pattern of trees planted in the view as an potential clue and searched for such plantations and hill ranges. I found a very similar looking region in the Osuna od Spain. I tried
locating at Y-junction as it was there in the given view but i just couldn't find it.

## 4. Bonsai Bankai:
It was obvious thaty this was hinted to some location in Japan but upon translating the shop sign it was something close to Bonsai garden and also upon observing i saw a railway crossing near
this location. So using these clues i narrowed down my searching to Nagoya in Aichi region of Japan. I found many possible locations but they were just not the right one.
